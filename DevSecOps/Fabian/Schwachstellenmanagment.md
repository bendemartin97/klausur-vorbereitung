## CVSS 

### Base Metrics
CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) v3.1 is a standardized method for evaluating the severity of a security vulnerability. The Base Metrics are the core component of the CVSS score, and they provide a quantitative representation of the underlying characteristics of a vulnerability. The Base Metrics are divided into three groups:
1.  Attack Vector (AV): Reflects the ease of access to the vulnerable component from an attacker's perspective, such as whether the attack requires local or network access.
    
2.  Attack Complexity (AC): Describes the complexity of the attack required to exploit the vulnerability, such as whether it requires special knowledge or skills.
    
3.  Privileges Required (PR): Refers to the level of access required to perform the attack, such as whether the attacker needs administrative or root privileges.
    
4.  User Interaction (UI): Indicates whether the vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction, such as whether the user needs to take a specific action for the attack to succeed.
    
5.  Scope (S): Specifies whether the vulnerability affects resources only within the scope of the vulnerable component or whether it can impact resources outside the vulnerable component as well.
    
6.  Confidentiality Impact (C): Refers to the impact on the confidentiality of data, such as whether the attacker can access or modify sensitive information.
    
7.  Integrity Impact (I): Describes the impact on the integrity of data, such as whether the attacker can modify or destroy data.
    
8.  Availability Impact (A): Refers to the impact on the availability of the vulnerable component, such as whether the attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition.
