- _two main goals:_
	- to help organizations develop and maintain secure applications

- create secure coding checklist
- tailor asvs to your use case
### Level 1: Opportunistic (Minimum Requirement)
- application achives, if it adequately defends against security vulnerabilities, that are __easy to discover or included in the OWASP Top 10__
- verification:
	- automatically by tools
	- simply manually
	- without access to source code (black box)
- Threat agents focus on vulneralibities, which are:
	- easy to find
	- easy to exploit
### Level 2: Standard (Normal Requirements)
- application achives, if it adequately __defends against most of the risks associated with software today__
- for applications, __that handle significant b2b transactions__
- Threat agents will typically:
	- skilled & motivated attackers 
	- use tools & techniques effective
### Level 3: Advanced (Maximum Requirements)
- applications achiv
